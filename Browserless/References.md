# BrowserQL Schema

This document is a complete technical specification of our full-length GraphQL API, called BrowserQL. This document is designed for developers and engineers that want a precise and low-level understanding of the API structure. For more introductory how-to and getting-started guides, [click here](https://docs.browserless.io/browserql/start).

This GraphQL schema contains every mutation, but to get you started the ones you'll use most will probably include:

- goto
- reject
- proxy
- click
- type
- html
- reconnect
